Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
======================================

The NWBInspector tool offers convenient command-line usage via any standard Conda or Python terminal.

You may then run the NWBInspector via the command line via the following usages

::

    # supply a path to a single NWBFile
    nwbinspector path/to/my/data.nwb

    # supply a path to a directory containing several NWBFiles (this will recurse to subdirectories)
    nwbinspector path/to/my/data/dir/


which should quickly display a basic report to your console window.


All available options for the CLI may be viewed by calling :code:`nwbinspector --help`. We will now highlight some of
the most useful of these options.



Streaming
---------

If the NWB file(s) you wish to inspect are already on the :dandi-archive:`DANDI archive <>`, you can run the NWB Inspector directly on that DANDI set instead of having to download it by specfying the DANDI set ID (six-digit identifier) as the path and setting the ``--stream`` (compare to :code:`--stream` flag.

This usage will require you to install the ROS3 driver - the general tutorial for ROS3 streaming of NWB files can be found on the :ros3-tutorial:`PyNWB documentation <>`. See :ref:`api_streaming` for a more advanced tutorial using the API functions.

::

    nwbinspector 000017 --stream


.. note::

    You can also specify the exact S3 path instead of the DANDI set ID if known. When specifying only the DANDI set ID, the S3 paths of all NWB assets are automatically fetched for your convenience.




Formatting the Report
---------------------

The basic report layout organizes by :py:attr:`~nwbinspector.register_check.InspectorMessage.importance` first and
:py:attr:`~nwbinspector.register_check.InspectorMessage.file_path` last.

However, the NWBInspector supports more general organization as defined by the `--levels` flag. To use this flag,
you must pass a series a comma-separated words that correspond to any attributes of the
:py:class:`~nwbinspector.register_check.InspectorMessage` in any order.

For example,

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data/dir/ --levels check_function_name,object_type,file_path

.. note::

    The :py:attr:`~nwbinspector.register_check.InspectorMessage.message` itself cannot be used in organization.

The ascending or descending order of each of these levels may be additionally controlled with the `--reverse` flag,
which is likewise a comma-separated series of boolean words.

For example,

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data/dir/ --levels check_function_name,object_type,file_path --reverse false,true,false

.. note::

    Valid 'boolean words' are any capitalizations of the words ``"false", "true"`` or characters ``"F", "T"``, and even
    numbers like ``"0, 1"``.


The defalt report also aggregates identical outputs into a summary over multiple files; running

::

    nwbinspector 000017 --stream

gives an output containing

.. image:: ../images/example_file_path_aggregation.png

as an example. It will do this any time the last value of the ``--levels`` list is ``file_path``. To see the full report of every
issue over all files, use the ``--detailed`` flag.



Saving the Report
-----------------

There are many common options you can specify with flags, such as saving the report for future reference...

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data.nwb --report-file-path path/to/my/nwbinspector_report.txt


If a report file from a previous run of the inspector is already present at the location, it can be overwritten with
the ``-o`` or ``--overwrite`` flag...

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data.nwb --report-file-path path/to/my/nwbinspector_report.txt -o



Faster Inspection
-----------------

The NWBInspector supports parallelization over a directory to allow the NWBInspector to run many times faster. To use
this feature, simply set the ``--n-jobs`` flag to either a positive integer corresponding to the number of CPUs you
wish to use, or set to ``-1`` to use all available system resources.

For example,

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data/dir/ --n-jobs -1



External Modules
----------------

If the NWBFiles being inspected require an external module to parse, or have externally defined check registries (such
as those specific to an :nwb-schema:ref:`NWB Extension<extending-the-format>`), these can be specified with the ``-m``
or ``--modules`` flag.

For example,

::

    nwbinspector path/to/my/data.nwb -m my_extension_module1 my_extension_module2
