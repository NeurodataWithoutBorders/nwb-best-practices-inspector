Names

Standard Names
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a default, name class instances with the same name as the class.

Many of the Neurodata Types in NWB allow you to set their name to something other than the default name.

This allows multiple objects of the same type to be stored side-by-side and allows data writers to provide
human-readable information about the contents of the neurodata_type. If appropriate, simply use the name of the
Neurodata Type as the name of that object.

For instance, if you are placing an ElectricalSeries object in /acquisition that holds voltage traces for a
multichannel recording, consider simply naming that object "ElectricalSeries". This is the default_name for that
object, and naming it like this will increase your chances that analysis and visualization tools will operate
seamlessly with you data.There may be cases where you have multiple neurodata instances of the same type in the same
Group. In this case the instances must have unique names. If they are both equally important data sources, build upon
the class name (e.g. "ElectricalSeries_1" and "ElectricalSeries_2"). If one of the instances is an extra of less
importance, name that one something different (e.g. "ElectricalSeries" and "ElectricalSeries_extra_electrode").



.. _best_practice_name_slashes:

Do Not Use Slashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'/' is not allowed in Group or Dataset names, as this can confuse h5py and lead to the creation of an additional group.
Instead of including a forward slash in the name, please use "Over" like in DfOverF.

Descriptions

.. _best_practice_description:

Metadata and Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Names are not for storing meta-data, so meta-data should not be stored solely in the name of objects. It is OK to name
an object something like “ElectricalSeries_large_array” however the name alone is not sufficient documentation. In this
case, the source of the signal will be clear from the device of the rows from the linked electrodes table region, and
you should also include any important distinguishing information in the description field of the object. Make an effort
to make meta-data as explicit as possible. Good names help users but do not help applications parse your file.

As such, it is not recommended to use blank or default 'placeholder' descriptions.
